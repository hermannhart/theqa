## **Overview**
This repository contains research projects utilizing **TheQA**, a quantum-inspired computational framework designed for optimization problems, quantum simulations, and complexity analysis.
TheQA is a novel quantum-inspired algorithm that utilizes resonance patterns and structural optimization to enhance problem-solving efficiency. It runs on classical hardware (CPUs, GPUs) while achieving optimization performance comparable to quantum algorithms. TheQA has been applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and has demonstrated significant speed improvements over both classical and quantum computing approaches.

## **Features**

🧠 Quantum-Acceptance Principle: Uses resonance patterns for efficient optimization.
🚀 Runs on Classical Hardware: Works on CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs (e.g., IonQ).
📊 Comparative Benchmarking: Evaluates performance against classical heuristics and quantum processors.
🔬 Applicable to Various Optimization Problems: Usable in machine learning, graph theory, and simulations.

### **Projects Included**
- **📊 P-NP Analyzer**: Investigates the separation of P vs. NP using resonance analysis.
- **🧬 Biomolecule Quantum Simulation**: Uses TheQA with CUDA to analyze biomolecular structures.
- **📊 the_QA**: the "algorithm"
