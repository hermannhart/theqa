## **Overview**
This repository contains research projects utilizing **TheQA**, a quantum-inspired computational framework designed for optimization problems, quantum simulations, and complexity analysis.
TheQA leverages probability theory—laws of large numbers, central limit theorems, and concentration inequalities—to ensure stable, objective estimates of system structures. By tuning the stochastic "noise" level, TheQA amplifies weak signals via stochastic resonance, maximizing information extraction. Resonances are statistically significant patterns, distinguishable from random noise through robust metrics.

## **Features**

🧠 TheQA builds on established methods like Monte Carlo, Metropolis algorithms, and random projections, but its innovation lies in:

🚀 Tailored sample metric selection and aggregation.

📊 Creative application to novel mathematical domains (e.g., Collatz, dimensional bridges).

🔬 Empirical validation through bootstrapping and cross-platform reproducibility.
